                The love affair between Florence and roses dates back centuries. From ancient Roman gardens to Renaissance masterpieces, roses have long been a symbol of beauty, love, and passion in this iconic Italian city. As we explore Florence's rose gardens, we'll not only witness breathtaking floral displays but also step back in time, experiencing the city's rich horticultural heritage.</p>

                Jug and basin or wash sets<br>
                This good quality Spode 6 piece toilet set came from <br>a time late in the nineteenth century, when even well to do families didn’t have indoor plumbing. This set would have sat on a marble topped washstand in the bedroom, or in a small ensuite, ready for the morning ablutions. But first a maid would have filled the jug with hot water, which would then be poured into the basin.

                The tulip colors represent more than you might think. Color not only provides a visual stimulus but also an emotional experience. It influences how we think, feel and behave. We can express our feelings with the colors we choose. Knowing that, it is important to consider the tulip colors when planting in your garden. What do you want to express in your own tulip garden?

                Lotus thrive in warm water but need room to grow, <br>
                so finding the right pot is the key to success. We recommend that the smallest vessel for your lotus <br>be no less than 12” deep and 24” wide. And good <br>soil is essential in making sure your new lotus roots thrive rather than rot! Be sure to have a mixture rich in sand and clay with little organic matter. </p>

            <p class="contant">The story of our plants: marigold<br>
                We had a very warm and dry June this year. Specifically, the average mean temperature was 1.2ºC higher than the previous record. A record set a mere two years ago. As a result of all that dry heat our flowers died out. We probably should also have been watering them more. The planters had been leaking water even after little to moderate watering, annoying our neighbours below.

                The flower head is actually an inflorescence made of hundreds or thousands of tiny flowers called florets. The central florets look like the centre of a normal flower, apseudanthium. The benefit to the plant is that it is very easily seen by the insects and birds which pollinate it, and it produces thousands of seeds.
